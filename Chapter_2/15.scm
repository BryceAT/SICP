yes, Eva is correct
if 0 < a < b
then (a,b)/(a,b) = (a,b) * (1/b,1/a) = (a/b ,b/a) which contains 1 but is not exactly 1.
R1R2 / (R1 + R2) = (a,b)*(c,d) / ((a,b)+(c,d)) = (ac/(b+d), bd/(a+c))
1/(1/R1 + 1/R2) = (ac/(a+c), bd/(b+d))
but (b+d) > (a+c) for positive resistances so the second cacluation gives a smaller interval.
