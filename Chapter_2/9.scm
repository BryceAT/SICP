for addition the width of the resulting interval is the sum of the widths of the two intervals.
let the widths of the intervals be d1 and d2
then (a, a+2d1) + (b, b+2d2) = (a+b, a+b +2(d1+d2)).

To this this is not the case for multiplication in the case 0<a,b
then
(a,a+2d1) * (b,b+2d2) = (ab, ab + 2(ad2+bd1+d1d2))
so that the size of a and b affect the width of the interval.
